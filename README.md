# toys-r-us-locations-april-2018

In early April, 2018 I wrote a Python script to step through the store locator on the toysrus.com website.

I have curated this dataset and made it available here as a point-in-time snapshot of where Toys “R” Us stores existed on April 2, 2018.

Here is a my blog post on this project: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/snapshot-toys-r-us-store-locations-april-2018-sean-maday/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/snapshot-toys-r-us-store-locations-april-2018-sean-maday/)
